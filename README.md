# 30-Days-Of-Python
A Personal Pyhton Refresh

I have taken a temporary ‘leave of absence’ - shall we say, from programming. It don’t want to make excuses but I think one of the main factors for me was that I was only programming for job interviews, tirelessly trying to solve Leetcode questions with the pressure of not succeeding and not landing a job. Now, I want to refresh myself, relive what is like to code and reignite that passion inside of me starting with Python, where it all begun for me. 

I shall be attempting the ‘[30 Days of Python](https://github.com/Asabeneh/30-Days-Of-Python)’ challenge created by [**Asabeneh S. Yetayeh](https://github.com/Asabeneh).** He describes it as a step-by-step guide learning python in 30(+) days. This wouldn’t be the first time I’ve gone back to basics on how to program, but I’m confident I’m in a better head space now and really aim to make the most of this. I can admit that I’ve been dependent on ChatGPT recently, trying so hard to be perfect, however I think the true nature of humans is to not be perfect, and also the way to best learn to code is through grit, struggle and determination.

This project will be a record/diary of what I’ve learnt, but also a reference for me that I can come look back on to revise any key concepts.
